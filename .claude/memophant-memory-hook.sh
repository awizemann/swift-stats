# start. The hook runs BEFORE this session's MCP connection, so it confirms the PIECES are in
# place (the binary is present + memophant is registered + this repo has a .memory/ tier), not
# that the model has connected. Emitted FIRST so the agent leads with "tools available"; the
# operator's custom instructions follow. tool_count is enriched from health.json when present
# (the app writes it on the main checkout; it's gitignored, so absent in worktrees — the line
# still shows, just without the count).
# Match the SERVER-REGISTRATION key `"memophant":` (object key → trailing colon, optional space
# before it as Foundation's pretty-printer emits) — NOT the bare `"memophant"` that also appears
# as the `--default-project` arg VALUE in the args array (no colon), which would false-positive.
